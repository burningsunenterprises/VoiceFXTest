Originally presented at JavaOne 2011, the VoiceFX framework has been open-sourced to the
public for use within their JavaFX Script and Visage applications.

Pre-Requisites
========================================================================================

The VoiceFX framework was originally presented using the Sphinx-4 library for speech
recognition; however, we have tested using the JSAPI2 libraries from Conversay.

You will need to have the libraries installed and available on your machine for VoiceFX
to work properly.
